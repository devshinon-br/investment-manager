# The project investmentManager
## ***Investment Manager***
A project aimed at the financial area, more specifically this project allows the investor to manage his shares, being able to visualize here his investment and the number
of shares acquired in that period that he specifies as a parameter. In addition, the main idea is to allow you to view your gain by asset, that is, by the “name” of the stock.

To put this project into practice it was used:
- *Java version 1.8*,
- *Latest version of Spring Boot*,
- *Angular CLI version 11.1.2*
- and other additional dependencies already present in the project.
